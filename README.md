### Description of our game
In this hackathon, our mission is to create a captivating text-based video game that explores the unwavering loyalty of a cat towards its human companion and celebrates the profound love shared between humans and cats. Introducing our heartfelt creation: **"Feline: Far From Home."**

In this game, you will assume the role of a devoted little cat who has been left behind by its human. Filled with a deep sense of loyalty and longing, the cat embarks on an extraordinary quest to find its beloved human. As the player, you hold the key to guiding this feline protagonist on a journey that showcases the power of love and devotion.

Throughout the adventure, the cat will encounter diverse characters and encounters, each representing unique aspects of the human-cat bond. Your choices and actions will determine the cat's fate as it navigates through challenges, forms connections, and overcomes obstacles in its quest to reunite with its human.

Drawing inspiration from the real-life story of Oyen, the cherished orange cat of the Raziqin family, **"Feline: Far From Home"** aims to capture the essence of loyalty and love that exists between humans and their feline companions. Immerse yourself in this heartwarming tale where the bonds of friendship and the strength of unconditional love prevail.
